# Human Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

Using CNN with `TensorFlow`.

### How to use:

You can download any of the two files in this repository based on your preference.

a.	The `FER_Result.ipynb` file contains the links to the data set `FER 2013` I used and the trained model `emotion_detection_model.h5`. This file contains all the code and their corresponding results displayed and you can access it using a Jupyter notebook. 

b.	`The FER_code.py` file contains only the code without any result. You can access the file using Jupyter notebook or any suitable IDE that supports python.
